# M-NIST-Dataset-Project
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9.
